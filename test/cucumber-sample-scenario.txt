Given I am a <retailer>
When I set the default payment method
and I place an order
and I switch to <brewer>
and I accept the order
and I invoice the order
Then the invoice payment should have the default payment method selected

Examples:

|key    |brewer           |retailer           |distributor|
|payment|boozang-brewer-ar|boozang-retailer-ap|-          |
